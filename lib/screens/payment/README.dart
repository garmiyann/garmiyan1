/*
Payment Screens Organization

Your payment folder structure now looks like:

lib/screens/payment/
├── payment_screen.dart              // Main payment dashboard
├── payment_history_screen.dart      // Transaction history 
├── card_management_screen.dart      // Credit/debit card management
├── send_money_screen.dart           // Send money to contacts
├── bill_payment_screen.dart         // Pay utility bills
└── payment_screens.dart             // Barrel export file

How to import payment screens:

Option 1: Import individual screens
import 'payment/payment_screen.dart';
import 'payment/payment_history_screen.dart';
import 'payment/card_management_screen.dart';
import 'payment/send_money_screen.dart';
import 'payment/bill_payment_screen.dart';

Option 2: Import all payment screens at once
import 'payment/payment_screens.dart';

Benefits of this organization:
1. Easy to find payment-related screens
2. Clean project structure
3. Easy to add more payment features
4. Better code maintainability
5. Can import all payment screens with one line

Next steps to expand payment functionality:
- Add more screens: QR code scanner, wallet settings, transaction receipts
- Connect to real payment APIs (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Add payment security features (PIN, biometric authentication)
- Implement real-time notifications for transactions
