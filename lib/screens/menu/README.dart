Menu Screens Organization

Your menu folder structure now looks like:

lib/screens/menu/
├── tiktok_studio_screen.dart        // Creator tools and analytics
├── my_project_screen.dart           // Project management (drafts/published)
├── my_qr_code_screen.dart          // QR code sharing and management
└── menu_screens.dart               // Barrel export file

How to import menu screens:

Option 1: Import individual screens
import 'menu/tiktok_studio_screen.dart';
import 'menu/my_project_screen.dart';
import 'menu/my_qr_code_screen.dart';

Option 2: Import all menu screens at once
import 'menu/menu_screens.dart';

Menu Items Available:
1. TikTok Studio - Professional creator tools with analytics, video editor, content planner
2. My Project - Project management for drafts and published content
3. Balance - Earnings and virtual gifts management (existing)
